						A little background on me - my name is Jennifer Wadella, and you can tweet at me @likeOMGitsFEDAY. It's a handle from my gaming days, my actual handle, Fedaykin, was too hard to pronounce, so my clan mates called me "Feday" instead. Am I the only one who wonders about where peoples' handles come from? Welp, now you know my story. 
						<ol>
							<li>I work as a Front-end developer at VML. I went to school for graphic design and business management. I thought I wanted to be a creative director. Hah. No. I fell into web development by accident, and having been loving life (almost) every day since.  </li>
							<li>In 2013 I decided I wanted to meet more lady-devs, so I founded Kansas City Women in Technology. It's interesting being the only woman in the room, hence my founding of a more specific developer community.</li>

						So... why are developer communities important? 
						<br /><br />
						This is a screencap of programming-motherfucker.com - a community of programmers. Motherfucker. After the chuckles from the vulgar vocabulary, this website is a great manifesto of a programmer community. Because what do we do? Programming, motherfucker.
						<br /><br />
						Just a heads up - I'm going to use programmer and developer interchangably throughout this presentation, there are differences, but not as it relates to this talk about communities.
						<br /><br />
						So, let's talk more specifically about why communities are important.

						Did you find this funny?
						<br /><br />
						There's a reason companys have started to pay attention to the culture they create. There's a reason we see google leading the charge in innovation, and I think it has something to do with the people they employ, and the way they interact. 
						<br /><br /> And Google is just my quick out-of-the-hat example that is likely to be known by everyone in the room, there are so many companies investing in creating a culture that attracts and retains developers.
						<br /><br />
						Developers have their own culture. We're a different breed. Like the comic shows, I've notice a lot of common themes in talking to coworkers and peers, despising busy work, approaching everything with a problem-solving mindset, you probably get most references to XKCD comics - my personal favorite being the ballmer peak.  
						<br /><br />
						What are things you look for in the culture of a company? And I'm not talking Star Trek posters and nerf wars, those things are fun, but don't make a culture. Do you want a company that is growth-oriented? New technology? Innovative projects. Contributions to open source projects? Time for R&D? Google’s “20 percent time policy” is an example of time for developers to work on projects that interested them. Gmail was one particuluarly popular product that came from this culture choice. Full stack development? Dev ops? No micro-management?  Project manager ratios? -Facebook's PM to dev is said to be in the range of 1 to 7 or 1 to 10.
						<br /><br />
						I will talk later about how culture doesn't have to be implemented from top-down and how you can create these culture changes from the ground level-up, but right now let's explore why our culture creates the need for a community. Because a community gives you ... acceptance.

						<aside class="notes">
							Acceptance. Maslow's freaking heirarchy.
							<br /><br />
							If you've never taken a psych class, I'll give you a crash course. 
							<br/><br />
							Maslow (1943) stated that people are motivated to achieve certain needs. When one need is fulfilled a person seeks to fullfil the next one, and so on. So he created this pyramid model - splitting needs into 5 levels. 
							<br /><br />
							The most basic is <b>physiological</b> - health, food, sleep... the most rudimentary things we need to survive. Once those needs are satisfied, we move on to <b>safety</b>. 
							<br /><br />
							We search for shelter, removal from danger, stability, freedom from fear. Fortunalely for us, this is already taken care of, at least until the impending zombie apocalypse occurs. In that case, I'm sure most people watch enough Walking Dead to know what NOT to do to survive.
							<br /><br />
							So once we're fed, on a diet of Mountain Dew and Dortios, of course, and safe, the next thing we look for is acceptance. There really is a biological reason behind needing to feel as though you belong to a group. 
							<br /><br />
							In early days of humanity, being a part of a group was necessary to survive. We were hunters and gatherers that shared food and cared for offspring in groups. We created and shared tools. If you were different in any way, or stood out, you would be cast from the group, and die on your own. That's why we're programmed to fear rejection - it's biological. 
							<br /><br />
							So we've established it is as simple as just a human need to feel <b>accepted</b> and to be part of a community. The next thing we strive for is self-esteem, confidence, achievement - respect from ourself and others.   
							<br /><br />
							If you don't have a community that can relate to your achievements, you may have a hard time fulfilling this need. At my last job, I was the only designer/developer. There was no basis for my level of achievement. As far as the client managers were concerned, I sat in my cube doing magic having graduated from the university of Hogwarts School of Webery. When I accomplished anything, there was nothing to compare it to, therefor no sense of achievement or self worth. Granted this was also before twitter took off and my only connection to anything relevant in the web industry was reading SmashingMagazine.com.
							<br /><br />
							Developer Communities are important in that they fill a need for acceptance, and give us a sense of belonging to others who understand what we do, and why it's so awesome. Let's be real - I love being a developer, and I'm sure you do too, that's why you're here. Being a part of a community who understands what you do can help you access your validity and skill level. 
							<br /><br />
							The very top level is <b>self-actualization</b> - achieving your potential. According to Maslow, a person is always “becoming” and never remains static in these terms. In self-actualization a person comes to find a meaning to life that is important to them. I don't run into many developers who are happy with how they are now; they're always looking to learn, grow, and improve. This may explain the discontent you feel when you're doing maintenance, or on a project that doesn't require any learning or growth. 
							<br /><br />

					<h2>Growth.</h2>
						<p>Surround yourself with greatness.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							This goes back a little bit to how communities help at a personal level. Birds of a feather flock together. You are who your friends are. There are a lot of sayings revolving around this concept. By creating a community in which you're surrounded by passionate, talented developers, you'll be giving yourself a direction to grow in, and motivation to become a 'rockstar'.
							<br /><br />
							We've discussed why communities are important at the individual level. Now let's look at how communities benfit the environment outside them.

				<section id="knowledge-sharing"> 
					<h2>Knowledge Sharing.</h2>
					<p>No man(woman) is an island.</p>
					<img class="fragment" src="img/rubberduck.jpg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						Discussion of new technologies, ways to solve common problems, and sharing tools and frameworks to help our workflow are all great outcomes of developer communities.
						<br /><br />
						I'm going to use my current workplace as an example: being a marketing agency, we're very client driven, and we have a wide variety of clients, but not necessarily with a wide variety of needs. Teams are created per client, and tunnel-vision is a serious side-effect. 
						<br /><br />
						There are many times where teams will be attempting to solve a similar problem, and because of lack of communication - knowledge sharing - a lot of time is spent trying to find a solution another team has already reached. I'll talk more about how we solved this problem later, but it DID include creating a developer community. 
						<br /> <br />
						Having a community is also monumental in helping you solve problems. Having someone to talk through an issue with is a proven way troubleshoot. Have a problem? Explain it out loud to a rubber duck, or your community member. In getting out of your head, you'll figure out what your issue is 9 times out of 10.

				<section id="collaboration">
					<h2>Collaboration.</h2>
					<img class="fragment" src="img/github-logo.png" />
					<aside class="notes">
						A while ago, developers had a reputation for being like mushrooms - they preferred to sit alone in a dark room and code. While there still be a few of these fungi left, a growing number of developers actually enjoy - and benefit -from interaction. And by interaction, I mean with other developers, not the project manager who's infamous line 'is it done yet?' has been repeated enough to make you want to crawl into that previously mentioned dark room. 
						<br /><br />
						Point being, developers are more collaborative than ever. We have our own social media platforms. We share expertise. We create open source software. We maintain projects as a community. And the web moves forward because of it.

							Earlier I mentioned how developer communities can solve tunnel vision with teams. When I started at my current job, I was on a new team, with all new employees. We had no connections to the rest of the company, and I was the only front-end dev. I didn't realize it at the time, but it was a lonely situation, and I wasn't

						Most of the time at work you'll see me head down writing code, headphones blaring. That's doesn't always indicate approachability. In truth, my team currently sits by the most active conference room, and it's noisy and distracting. Introduce developers to each other. Someone has a question? Match them with someone you know who has experience.
